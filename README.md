# ZeldaCloneInPygame

This is a simple game that I made as a college project to learn basic Python programming. The gameplay is based on the cult classic 'The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past'. As this was my first experience with Python, I found a tutorial called 'Creating a Zelda-style game in Python [with some Dark Souls elements]' to be immensely helpful.

To run the game, you'll need to install Python and Pygame on your system.
